To test the webservice, the project is oponed in VS. Just compile it and launch it.
I will open your browser with a default test client for soap request.

To test the webservice in REST mode, you could use a chrome extension like Advanced REST client ( URL below )

See the following screenshots to see a rest request with this tool
